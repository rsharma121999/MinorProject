### Setup

* Run `npm install` in the root directory which will installs all the back-end dependencies.
* `cd client` moved to client directory (Front-end directory)
* Run `npm install` again in the client directory. This will install all the react dependencies.
* Add `.env` file in root directory and set all the env variables `(DATABASEURL, JWT_SECRET_KEY and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY)`.
* Run `npm run dev`, this will automatically start the servers. Back-end will be running on PORT 5000 and Front-end on PORT 3000.
